MSF-TEST SUITE Project

Usage
-----
	Mobile client should connect to testws.beta.marketsimplified.com and initialize (Put 800 Request ) the device.
	
	Goto http://testws.beta.marketsimplified.com from the browser , where devices are listed. 
	
	Select your device and save the configuration. If it was successfull ,the server will send the responses to the application which is configured.

	To add custom test cases,  upload the file in yaml format and it must follow the MSF protocol format.

    Sample opx.yml (The file contents are in between dotted lines)
	--------------------------------------------------------------
    434:
    -  436 <OK|SESSION>##..##
	-  656 <Invalid Session>##..##

	310:
	- 312 <goog|1|1|2|3|4|6|7|4|3>##

	---------------------------------------------------------------


	If any response needs to be sent with any delay, add test_timeout=10 in the extended modifier.

	Example : For "310" request, if the response is mapped as 312 <...>##test_timeout=5..## then server will send the response only after 5 seconds.
